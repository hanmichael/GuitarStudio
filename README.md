# GuitarStudio
Audio processing for Android using NDK, focusing Guitar

## Setup

### NDK
To setup the NDK, you must follow [this tutorial](http://kn-gloryo.github.io/Build_NDK_AndroidStudio_detail/)
You can watch the video of the tutorial [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RmPuwdxR1qs)

## Use Cases
| Use Case | Status |
|----------|:--------:|
| The app should capture audio from an external audio source |  |
| The app should send the processed signal through an external audio output |  |
| The process of capturing, processing and emitting the audio should have a very small delay |  | 
| The app should offer at least 2 effects (Distortion and Delay) |  | 

## Limitations
* Due to hardware specificities, the app will not work in all the android devices
